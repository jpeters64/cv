        <h3>Application Design and Development Experience Sample</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Designed and developed a Financial industry HouseHolding Keys application to generate and maintain location, family and relationship keys in a Neo4j graph database to show how all of a bank’s individual and organization customers are related to assist in fraud investigations.</li>
            <li>Designed and developed a Neo4j graph database and SharePoint implementation of the Single View of Projects repository which enables professional services, pre-sales, product management and engineering to view, search, and analyze professional service’s project, customer, partner and resource entities and the relationships between them.</li>
            <li>Designed and developed a  Financial industry application that uses text parsing and analytics to transform unstructured financial transaction text strings in unknown unstructured data formats (including individual and business names, account, address and relationship information) into structured information for Single Customer View (SCV)  implementations and decision making.</li>
            <li>Co-designed and developed a marketing application for processing customer, sales transaction and promotion data to create a master repository of customers in a Neo4j graph database and identify which customer is involved in a sales transaction and which sales transaction was potentially influenced by a promotion. The solution is also used for profit-impacting customer behavior and propensity analysis by identifying and grouping all sales transactions by their customer in order to predict customer behaviors and propensities.</li>
            <li>Co-designed and developed Single Customer View implementation functionality that transliterated individual names using Spectrum transliteration and  translated company names from non-Latin scripts to Latin script from countries such as China, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Korea using Google translate web service via a Spectrum external web service.</li>
            <li>Designed and developed Single Customer View implementation functionality to parse and standardize company names against the PB World Premium Point of Interest dataset (WPPOI) and enrich the business customer records with company registered name, trade name and brand name, segmentation fields for defining type of organization (SIC1, SIC2, SIC8, MiCode ect), address, phone email, relevant business information fields (e.g. sales volume) and business organization information (e.g. parent company). Fuzzy matching is used to compare the parsed company name, phone and address in the customer record to similarly parsed registered, trade and brand company name, address and phone information in the WPPOI dataset.</li>
            <li>Co-designed and developed Entity Resolution for Financial Crimes and Compliance software application to help banks more efficiently and cost-effectively detect and investigate financial crimes. This solution builds on Pitney Bowes Spectrum® technology and advanced algorithms to process transaction, account and customer data to identify external customers. This process includes:</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>Standardize, Validate, Parse payment data in different formats to extract external customer names and associated detail using business rules specific to payment type including semantic parsing </li>
                        <li>Run matching algorithms to identify same or similar looking entity names (customers and external  customers)</li>
                        <li>Assign a unique id, enrich the AML data and provide consolidated / enriched data to AML monitoring and other functions</li>
                        <li>Generate a master external customer repository  and make that available to other processes within the bank</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Designed and developed a Telecommunications industry application to simulate Linear Referencing and Dynamic Segmentation capabilities in order to calculate linear distance along a wireless drive test network according to FCC regulations.</li>
            <li>Designed and developed a Telecommunications industry web service to determine the required Wire Center information, found at each customer location using a spatial query, whether it is based on a geocode for an address or the latitude and longitude coordinates acquired by location aware devices like mobile phones as well, as the calculate the probability that the location is within each of the possible Wire Centers based on the error built in to the determination of the customers location.</li>
            <li>Designed and developed an Insurance Industry application to display on a map tornado event spatial clusters in relation to their magnitude and property damage caused for a user defined study area (drive time or radius around a specified address) and for a user-defined time period (Jan 1, 2000 to Jan 1, 2010 and for the months of March, April and May/tornado season) using R Density based DBScan Spatial Clustering to calculate spatial cluster for each tornado event.</li>
            <li>Designed and developed various web services:</li>
            <ul>
                        <li>Validate and geocode an input address and execute a find-the nearest queries to determine the nearest water bodies and distance to the  U.S. address </li>
                        <li>Validate and geocode an input address and execute a point in polygon query to determine BlockGroup, Tract, County, Congress, Senate, Assembly, School, NativeLand, Community District and OCFSRegion in N.Y. State</li>
                        <li>Validate and geocode an input address and execute a point in polygon query to determine to determine the appropriate health plans for Federal Government employees</li>
                        <li>Validate and geocode an input address and execute a point in polygon query to determine the 8-character CLLI code for the Wire Center that a customer address resides in, as well, as the related service RBOC/ILEC information</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Co-designed and developed a desktop application that helps lending institutions analyze (spatial and mapping), their lending patterns to ensure CRA (Community Reinvestment Act) compliance. An organization can compare its performance against its peers, easily mining all the data to identify historically underserved markets and uncover new lending opportunities.</li>
            <li>Designed and developed a web based E911 Coverage Analysis application that is used by 911 engineers and 911 local negotiators for E911 emergency service planning and operations to obtain coverage information on Rate Centers, PSAPs, LECs, LATAs, Counties, and Area codes for a specified area or address location. </li>
            <li>Designed and developed a web based Wireless Network Mapping application that enables approximately 100 concurrent emergency services users in communication centers to monitor in near real-time the status of the wireless network.</li>
            <li>Designed and developed a desktop application that generates a map of shortest or fastest drive routes with driving directions from a specified list of origin and destination locations in order to calculate the proportion of each route that is covered by specified wireless coverage.</li>
            <li>Designed and developed a mapping component for a biological aerosol warning system that provides an early warning capability for monitoring the perimeter of key military areas or other high value assets against aerosol attack.  </li>
